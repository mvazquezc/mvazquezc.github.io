We are talking about top_k, top_p and temperature. But before describing them, we need to understand the two main behaviors we can get from an LLM when it is sampling tokens:</description>

This post is the result of my exploratory work on LLMs. While I’ve made a strong effort to ensure the information is accurate, I’m far from an expert on the topic, and some details may not be entirely correct.</description>
