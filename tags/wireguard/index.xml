&lt;p&gt;Virtualizing environments is something I do quite often in a day-to-day basis, usually, these environments live in different hypervisors. While I don&amp;rsquo;t always need these environments to talk to each other, from time to time I need some sort of connectivity between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the VMs running on these hypervisors routed through the lab network is one of the solutions I have been using for a long time. For the last few days, I have been thinking of extending a virtual network across two hypervisors. This allows me to run VMs on this virtual network and get VMs to talk to each other without having to run these VMs in a routed lab network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
