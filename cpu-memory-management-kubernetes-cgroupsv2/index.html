If you detect something that is missing / wrong, please comment on the post!\nI’ll be using a Kubernetes v1.26 (latest at the time of this writing) with an operating system with support for cgroupsv2 like Fedora 37. The tool used to create the cluster is kcli and the command used was:\nkcli create kube generic -P ctlplanes=1 -P workers=1 -P ctlplane_memory=4096 -P numcpus=8 -P worker_memory=8192 -P image=fedora37 -P sdn=calico -P version=1.26 -P ingress=true -P ingress_method=nginx -P metallb=true -P domain=linuxera.org resource-mgmt-cluster Introduction to Cgroups As we explained in a previous post, Cgroups are used to limit what resources are available to containers on the system. In Kubernetes it’s not different.\nCgroups version 2 introduces improvements and new features on top of Cgroups version 1, you can read more about what changed in this link.\nIn the next sections we will see how we can limit memory and cpu for processes.\nLimiting memory using Cgroupsv2 An evolved memory controller is available in Cgroupsv2, it allows for better management of memory resources for the processes inside the cgroup. In this section we will cover how to hard limit a process to a given amount of memory, and how to use new controls to make our programs work on memory-restricted environments.\nHard limiting memory Hard limiting memory is pretty straightforward, we just set a memory.max and since the memory is a resource that cannot be compressed, once the process reaches the limit it will be killed.\nWe will be using this python script:\ncat \u003c /opt/dumb.py f = open(\"/dev/urandom\", \"r\", encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\") data = \"\" i=0 while i \u003c 20: data += f.read(10485760) # 10MiB i += 1 print(\"Used %d MiB\" % (i * 10)) EOF Let’s create a new cgroup under the system.slice:\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest Set a limit of 200MiB of RAM for this cgroup and disable swap:\necho \"200M\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest/memory.max echo \"0\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest/memory.swap.max Add the current shell process to the cgroup:\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest/cgroup.procs Run the python script:\npython3 /opt/dumb.py Attention\nEven if the script stopped at 80MB that’s caused because the python interpreter + shared libraries consume also memory. We can check the current memory usage in the cgroup by using the systemd-cgtop system.slice/memorytest command or with something like this MEMORY=$(cat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest/memory.current);echo $(( $MEMORY / 1024 / 1024 ))MiB\nUsed 10 MiB Used 20 MiB Used 30 MiB Used 40 MiB Used 50 MiB Used 60 MiB Used 70 MiB Used 80 MiB Killed Remove the cgroup:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest/ Better memory management In the previous section we have seen how to hard-limit our processes to a given amount of memory, in this section we will be making use of new configurations to better allow our program to run under memory-restricted scenarios.\nAs we said, memory cannot be compressed, and as such, when a process reaches the limit set it will be OOMKilled. While this remains true, some memory in use by our program can be reclaimed by the kernel. This will free some memory that is no longer in use.\nIn Cgroupsv2 we can work with the following memory configurations:\nmemory.high: Memory usage throttle limit. If the cgroup goes over this limit, the cgroup processes will be throttled and put under heavy reclaim pressure. memory.max: As we saw earlier, this is the memory usage hard limit. Anything going beyond this number gets OOMKilled. memory.low: Best-effort memory protection. While processes in this cgroup or child cgroups are below this threshold, the cgroup memory won’t be reclaimed unless it cannot be reclaimed from other unprotected cgroups. memory.min: Specifies a minimum amount of memory that the cgroup must always retain and that won’t be reclaimed by the system under any conditions as long as the memory usage is below the threshold defined. memory.swap.high: Same as memory.high but for swap. memory.swap.max: Same as memory.max but for swap. Note\nMemory throttling is a resource control mechanism that limits the amount of memory a process can use, when throttled the kernel will try to reclaim memory. Keep in mind that memory reclaiming is an I/O expensive process.\nIn order to demonstrate how this works, we will be using the same python script we used previously.\nLet’s create a new cgroup under the system.slice:\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2 Set a limit of 200MiB of RAM for this cgroup and disable swap:\necho \"200M\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2/memory.max echo \"0\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2/memory.swap.max Set a throttle limit of 150MiB:\necho \"150M\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2/memory.high Add the current shell process to the cgroup:\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2/cgroup.procs Run the python script:\npython3 /opt/dumb.py Used 10 MiB Used 20 MiB Used 30 MiB Used 40 MiB Used 50 MiB Used 60 MiB Used 70 MiB Delete the cgroup:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest2/ We tried to limit the memory consumption for our process, and we failed. Determining the exact amount of memory required by an application is a difficult and error-prone task. Luckily for us, Facebook folks created senpain. Let’s see how we can use it to better determine the configuration for our process.\nDownload senpai:\ncurl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookincubator/senpai/main/senpai.py -o /tmp/senpai.py Create a new cgroup under the system.slice:\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3 Add the current shell process to the cgroup:\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3/cgroup.procs Run senpai in a different shell with the following command:\npython3 /tmp/senpay.py Run the python script:\npython3 /opt/dumb.py At this point senpai should’ve set the memory.high restrictions for our cgroups based on the usage of our python script:\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3/memory.high 437448704 We can stop senpai. We need around 420MiB memory to run our python script, so a better configuration for it would be:\nAttention\nWe are adding a max swap usage of 50M to ease memory reclaim.\necho \"450M\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3/memory.max echo \"50M\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3/memory.swap.max At this point we should be able to run the program with no issues:\npython3 /opt/dumb.py Used 10 MiB Used 20 MiB ... Used 190 MiB Used 200 MiB Delete the cgroup:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memorytest3/ Now that we have seen how to limit memory, let’s see how to limit CPU.\nLimiting CPU using Cgroupsv2 Limiting CPU is not as straightforward as limiting memory, since CPU can be compressed we can make sure that a process doesn’t use more CPU than allowed without having to kill it.\nWe need to configure the parent cgroup so it has the cpu and cpuset controllers enabled for its children groups. Below example configures the controllers for the system.slice cgroup which is the parent group we will be using. By default, only memory and pids controllers are enabled.\nEnable cpu and cpuset controllers for the /sys/fs/cgroup/ and /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice children groups:\necho \"+cpu\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control echo \"+cpuset\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control echo \"+cpu\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cgroup.subtree_control echo \"+cpuset\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cgroup.subtree_control Limiting CPU — Pin process to CPU and limit CPU bandwidth Let’s create a new cgroup under the system.slice:\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest Assign only 1 core to this cgroup\nAttention\nBelow command assigns core 0 to our cgroup.\necho \"0\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/cpuset.cpus Set a limit of half-cpu for this cgroup:\nAttention\nThe value for cpu.max is in units of 1/1000ths of a CPU core, so 50000 represents 50% of a single core.\necho 50000 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/cpu.max Add the current shell process to the cgroup:\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/cgroup.procs Download the cpuload utility:\ncurl -L https://github.com/vikyd/go-cpu-load/releases/download/0.0.1/go-cpu-load-linux-amd64 -o /tmp/cpuload \u0026\u0026 chmod +x /tmp/cpuload Run the cpu load:\nAttention\nWe’re requesting 1 core and 50% of the CPU, this should fit within the cpu.max setting.\n/tmp/cpuload -p 50 -c 1 If we check with systemd-cgtop system.slice/cputest the usage we will see something like this:\nControl Group Tasks %CPU Memory Input/s Output/s system.slice/cputest 6 47.7 856.0K - - Since we’re within the budget, we shouldn’t see any throttling happening:\nNote\nCPU throttling is a resource control mechanism that limits the amount of CPU time a process can use, preventing it from consuming excessive CPU resources and affecting the performance of other processes.\ngrep throttled /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/cpu.stat nr_throttled 0 throttled_usec 0 If we stop the cpuload command and request 100% of 1 core we will see throttling:\n/tmp/cpuload -p 100 -c 1 Control Group Tasks %CPU Memory Input/s Output/s system.slice/cputest 6 50.0 720.0K - - grep throttled /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/cpu.stat nr_throttled 336 throttled_usec 16640745 Remove the cgroup:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/cputest/ This use case is very simple, we pinned our process to 1 core and limited the CPU to half a core. Let’s see what happens when multiple processes compete for the CPU.\nLimiting CPU — Pin processes to CPU and limit CPU bandwidth Let’s create a new cgroup under the system.slice:\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest Assign only 1 core to this cgroup\nAttention\nBelow command assigns core 0 to our cgroup.\necho \"0\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest/cpuset.cpus Set a limit of one cpu for this cgroup:\nAttention\nThe value for cpu.max is in units of 1/1000ths of a CPU core, so 100000 represents 100% of a single core.\necho 100000 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest/cpu.max Open two shells and attach their process to the cgroup:\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest/cgroup.procs Run the cpu load in one of the shells:\nAttention\nWe’re requesting 1 core and 100% of the CPU, this should fit within the cpu.max setting.\n/tmp/cpuload -p 100 -c 1 If we check for throttling we will see that no throttling is happening.\ngrep throttled /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest/cpu.stat nr_throttled 0 throttled_usec 0 Run another instance of cpuload on the other shell:\n/tmp/cpuload -p 100 -c 1 At this point, we shouldn’t see throttling, but the CPU time would be shared by the two processes, in the top output below we can see that each process is consuming half cpu.\nPID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 822742 root 20 0 4104 2004 1680 S 49.8 0.0 0:24.30 cpuload 822717 root 20 0 4104 2008 1680 S 49.5 0.1 6:28.51 cpuload Close the shells and remove the cgroup:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/compitingcputest/ In this use case, we pinned our process to 1 core and limited the CPU to one core. On top of that, we spawned two processes that competed for CPU. Since CPU bandwidth distribution was not set, each process got half cpu. In the next section we will see how to distribute CPU across processes using weights.\nLimiting CPU — Pin processes to CPU, limit and distribute CPU bandwidth Let’s create a new cgroup under the system.slice with two sub-groups (appA and appB):\nsudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/{appA,appB} Enable cpu and cpuset controllers for the /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest children groups:\necho \"+cpu\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/cgroup.subtree_control echo \"+cpuset\" \u003e\u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/cgroup.subtree_control Assign only 1 core to the parent cgroup\nAttention\nBelow command assigns core 0 to our cgroup.\necho \"0\" \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/cpuset.cpus Set a limit of one cpu for this cgroup:\nAttention\nThe value for cpu.max is in units of 1/1000ths of a CPU core, so 100000 represents 100% of a single core.\necho 100000 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/cpu.max Open two shells and attach their process to the different child cgroups, then run cpuload:\nShell 1\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appA/cgroup.procs /tmp/cpuload -p 100 -c 1 Shell 2\necho $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appB/cgroup.procs /tmp/cpuload -p 100 -c 1 If you check the top output, you will see that CPU is evenly distributed across both processes, let’s modify weights to give more CPU to appB cgroup.\nIn cgroupvs1 there was cpu shares concept, in cgroupsv2 this changed and now we use cpu weights. All weights are in the range [1, 10000] with the default at 100. This allows symmetric multiplicative biases in both directions at fine enough granularity while staying in the intuitive range. If we wanted to give appA a 30% of the CPU and appB the other 70%, providing that the parent cgroup CPU weight is set to 100 this is the configuration we will apply:\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/cpu.weight 100 Assign 30% of the cpu to appA\necho 30 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appA/cpu.weight Assign 70% of the cpu to appB\necho 70 \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appB/cpu.weight If we look at the top output we will see something like this:\nAttention\nYou can see how one of the cpuload processes is getting 70% of the cpu while the other is getting the other 30%.\nPID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 1077 root 20 0 4104 2008 1680 S 70.0 0.1 12:41.27 cpuload 1071 root 20 0 4104 2008 1680 S 30.0 0.1 12:24.14 cpuload Close the shells and remove the cgroups:\nWarning\nMake sure you closed the shell attached to the cgroup before running the command below, otherwise it will fail.\nsudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appA/ sudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/appB/ sudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/distributedbandwidthtest/ At this point, we should have a clear understanding on how the basics work, next section will introduce these concepts applied to Kubernetes.\nResource Management on Kubernetes We won’t be covering the basics, I recommend reading the official docs. We will be focusing on CPU/Memory requests and limits.\nCgroupsv2 configuration for a Kubernetes node Before describing the cgroupsv2 configuration, we need to understand how Kubelet configurations will impact cgroupsv2 configurations. In our test cluster, we have the following Kubelet settings in order to reserve resources for system daemons:\nsystemReserved: cpu: 500m memory: 500Mi If we describe the node this is what we will see:\noc describe node Attention\nYou can see how half cpu (500m) and 500Mi of memory have been subtracted from the allocatable capacity.\nCapacity: cpu: 4 memory: 6069552Ki Allocatable: cpu: 3500m memory: 5455152Ki Even if we remove resources from the allocatable capacity, depending on the QoS of our pods we would be able to over commit on resources, at that point, eviction may happen and cgroups will make sure that pods with more priority get the required resources they asked for.\nCgroupsv2 configuration on the node In a regular Kubernetes node we will have at least three main parent cgroups:\nkubepods.slice: Parent cgroup used by Kubernetes to place pod processes. It has two child cgroups named after pod QoS inside: kubepods-besteffort.slice and kubepods-burstable.slice. Guaranteed pods get created inside this parent cgroup. system.slice: Parent cgroup used by the O.S to place system processes. Kubelet, sshd, etc. run here. user.slice: Parent cgroup used by the O.S to place user processes. When you run a regular command, it runs here. Note\nIn Systemd a Slice is a concept for hierarchically managing resources of a group of processes. This management is done by creating a cgroup. Scopes manage a set of externally created processes, the main purpose of a scope is grouping worker processes for managing resources.\n/sys/fs/cgroup/ ├── kubepods.slice │ ├── kubepods-besteffort.slice │ │ └── kubepods-besteffort-pod7589d90f_83af_4a05_a4ee_8bb078db72b8.slice │ │ ├── cri-containerd-2be6af51555a1d9ebb8678f3254e81b5f3547dfc230b07a2c1067f5d430b7221.scope │ │ └── cri-containerd-cbce8911226299472976f069f20afe0ba20c80037f9fd8394c0a8f8aaac60bee.scope │ ├── kubepods-burstable.slice │ │ └── kubepods-burstable-pode00fb079_24be_4039_b2cb_f68876881d70.slice │ │ ├── cri-containerd-a0c611e1b04856e9d565dfef25746d7bdcaaf12bb92fff6221aa6b89a12fbb31.scope │ │ └── cri-containerd-ea6361278865134bd9d52e718baa556e7693d766ab38d28d64941a1935fae004.scope │ └── kubepods-podbe70a1c9_81c5_4764_b28f_0965edee08d0.slice │ ├── cri-containerd-208bf4e7ddeef45a3bd3acff96ff0747b35e9204cea418082b586df6adf022ad.scope │ └── cri-containerd-71305184cec893cd21cfef2cbe699453ad89a51e4f60586670f194574f287a53.scope ├── system.slice │ ├── kubelet.service │ └── sshd.service └── user.slice └── user-1000.slice In order to get these cgroups created, Kubelet uses one of the two available drivers: systemd or cgroupsfs. Cgroupsv2 are only supported by systemd driver.\nThe root cgroup kubepods.slice and the QoS cgroups kubepods-besteffort.slice and kubepods-burstable.slice are created by Kubelet when it starts, on top of that Kubelet will create a cgroup (using the driver) as soon as a new Pod gets created. The pod will have from 1 to N containers, the cgroups for these containers will be created by the container runtime by using the driver as well.\nOn the output above you can see different cgroups for pods like kubepods-besteffort-pod7589d90f_83af_4a05_a4ee_8bb078db72b8.slice and one for a container like cri-containerd-2be6af51555a1d9ebb8678f3254e81b5f3547dfc230b07a2c1067f5d430b7221.scope.\nSo far, we have been looking at the configuration of cgroups via the fileystem. Systemd tooling can be used for that as well:\nsystemctl show --no-pager cri-containerd-2be6af51555a1d9ebb8678f3254e81b5f3547dfc230b07a2c1067f5d430b7221.scope CPUWeight=1 MemoryMax=infinity CPU Bandwidth configuration on the node In the previous sections we have talked about how cpu.weight works for distributing CPU bandwidth to processes. The parent cgroups in a Kubernetes node will be configured as follows:\nsystem.slice: A cpu.weight of 100. user.slice: A cpu.weight of 100. In a Kubernetes node, we won’t have much/any user processes running. So at the end, the two cgroups competing for resources will be system.slice and kubepods.slice. But wait, what cpu.weight is configured for kubepods.slice?\nWhen Kubelet starts it detects the number of CPUs available on the node, on top of that it reads the systemReserved.cpu configuration. That will give you a number of milicores available for Kubernetes to use on that node.\nFor example, if I have a 4 CPU node that’s 4000 milicores, if I reserved 500m for the system resources (kubelet, sshd, etc.) that leaves Kubernetes with 3500 milicores that can be assigned to workloads.\nNow, Kubelet knows that 3500 milicores is the amount of CPU that can be assigned to workloads (and assigned means that is more or less assured in case workloads request it). The cgroups cpu.weight needs to be configured so CPU get distributed accordingly, let’s see how that’s done:\nIn the past (cgroupsv1), CPU Shares were used and every CPU was represented by 1024 Shares. Now, we need to translate from shares to weight and the community has a formula for that (more info here). In cgroupsv2 we still use Shares under the hood, but that’s only because the formula created to not having to change the specification requires them. So we have a constant that sets the Shares/CPU to 1024 and a function that translates milicores to shares. Finally, there is a function that translates CPU Shares to CPU Weight using the formula from 1. After we know the weight that needs to be applied to the kubepods.slice, the relevant code that does that is here and here.\nContinuing with the example, the cpu.weight for our 4 CPU node with 500 milicores reserved for system resources would be:\nFormula being used: (((cpuShares - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1\ncpuShares = 3.5 Cores * 1024 = 3584\ncpu.weight = (((3584 - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1 = 137,62\nIf we check our node:\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods.slice/cpu.weight 137 At this point we know how the different cgroups get configured on the node, next let’s see what happens when kubepods.slice and system.slice compete for cpu.\nkubepods.slice and system.slice competing for CPU In the previous section we have seen how the different cgroups get configured on our 4 CPU node, in this section we will see what happens when the two slices compete for CPU.\nLet’s say that we have two processes, the sshd service and a guaranteed pod. Both processes have access to all 4 CPUs and they’re trying to use the 100% of the 4 CPUs.\nTo calculate the percentage of CPU allocated to each process, we can use the following formulas:\nPod Process: (cpu.weight of pod / total cpu.weight) * number of CPUs Ssh Process: (cpu.weight of ssh / total cpu.weight) * number of CPUs In this case, the total cpu.weight is 237 (137 from kubepods.slice + 100 from system.slice), so:\nPod Process: (137 / 237) * 4 = 2.31 CPUs or ~231% Ssh Process: (100 / 237) * 4 = 1.68 CPUs or ~168% So pod process would get around 231% of the available CPU (400% -\u003e 4 Cores x 100) and ssh process would get around 168% of the available CPU.\nDanger\nKeep in mind that these calculations are not 100% accurate, since the CFS will try to assign CPU in the fairest way possible and results may vary depending on the system load and other process running on the system.\nCgroupsv2 configuration for a Pod In the previous sections we have focused on the configuration at the node level, but let’s see what happens when we create a pod on the different QoS.\nCgroup configuration for a BestEffort Pod We will be using this pod definition:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: run: cputest name: cputest-besteffort spec: containers: - image: quay.io/mavazque/trbsht:latest name: cputest resources: {} dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst restartPolicy: Always Once created, in the node where the pod gets scheduled we can find the cgroup that was created by using these commands:\nGet container id:\ncrictl ps | grep cputest-besteffort 2be6af51555a1 b67fff43d1e61 4 minutes ago Running cputest 0 cbce891122629 cputest-besteffort Get the cgroups path:\ncrictl inspect 2be6af51555a1 | jq '.info.runtimeSpec.linux.cgroupsPath' \"kubepods-besteffort-pod7589d90f_83af_4a05_a4ee_8bb078db72b8.slice:cri-containerd:2be6af51555a1d9ebb8678f3254e81b5f3547dfc230b07a2c1067f5d430b7221\" With above information, the full path will be /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods.slice/kubepods-besteffort.slice/kubepods-besteffort-pod7589d90f_83af_4a05_a4ee_8bb078db72b8.slice\nIf we check the cpu.max, cpu.weight and memory.max configuration, this is what we see:\ncpu.max is set to max 100000. cpu.weight is set to 1. memory.max is set to max. As we can see, the pod is allowed to use as much CPU as it wants, but it has the lowest weight possible which means that it only will get CPU when other processes with higher weight yield some. You can expect a lot of throttling for these pods when the system is under load. On the memory side, it can use as much memory as it wants, but if the cluster requires evicting this pod to reclaim memory in order to schedule more priority pods the container will be OOMKilled. The max from the cpu.max config means that the processes can use all the CPU time available on the system (which varies depending on the speed of your CPU).\nCgroup configuration for a Burstable Pod We will be using this pod definition:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: run: cputest name: cputest-burstable spec: containers: - image: quay.io/mavazque/trbsht:latest name: cputest resources: requests: cpu: 2 memory: 100Mi dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst restartPolicy: Always Once created, in the node where go the cgroup configuration by following the steps described previously and this is the configuration we see:\ncpu.max is set to max 100000. cpu.weight is set to 79. memory.max is set to max. The pod will be allowed to use as much CPU as it wants, and the weight has been set to it has certain priority over other processes running on the system. On the memory side it can use as much memory as it wants, but if the cluster requires evicting this pod to reclaim memory in order to schedule more priority pods the container will be OOMKilled. The cpu.weight value 79 comes from the formula we saw earlier ((((cpuShares - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1):\ncpuShares = 2 Cores * 1024 = 2048 cpu.weight = (((2048 - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1 = 79,04 Cgroup configuration for a Guaranteed Pod We will be using this pod definition:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: run: cputest name: cputest-guaranteed spec: containers: - image: quay.io/mavazque/trbsht:latest name: cputest resources: requests: cpu: 2 memory: 100Mi limits: cpu: 2 memory: 100Mi dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst restartPolicy: Always Once created, in the node where go the cgroup configuration by following the steps described previously and this is the configuration we see:\ncpu.max is set to 200000 100000. cpu.weight is set to 79. memory.max is set to 104857600 (100Mi = 104857600 bytes). The cpu.max value is different to what we have seen so far, the first value 200000 is the allowed time quota in microseconds for which the process can run during one period. The second value 100000 specific the length of the period. Once the processes consume the time specified by this quota, they will be throttled for the remained of the period and won’t be allowed to run until the next period. This specific configuration allows our processes to run every 0.2 seconds of every 1 second (1/5th). On the memory side, the container can use up to 100Mi once it reaches this value if kernel will try to reclaim some memory, if it cannot be reclaimed the container will be OOMKilled.\nEven if guaranteed QoS will ensure that your application gets the CPU it wants, sometimes your application may benefit from burstable capabilities since the CPU won’t be throttled during peaks (e.g: more visits to a web server).\nHow Kubepods Cgroups compete for resources In the previous examples we have seen how the different pods get different CPU configurations. But what happens if they compete against them for resources?\nIn order for the guaranteed pods to have more priority than burstable pods, and these to have more priority than besteffort different weights get set for the three slices. In a 4 CPU node these are the settings we get:\nGuaranteed pods will run under kubepods.slice which has a cpu.weight of 137. Burstable pods will run under kubepods.slice/kubepods-burstable.slice which has a cpu.weight of 86. BestEffort pods will run under kubepods.slice/kubepods-besteffort.slice which has a cpu.weight of 1. As we can see from above configuration, the weights define the CPU priority. Keep in mind that pods running inside the same parent slice can compete for resources. In this situation, when they’re competing for resources the total cpu.weight will be the one from summing all their parent cgroup cpu weights. For example:\nWe have two burstable pods, these are the cpu weights that will be configured (based on the formulas we have seen so far):\nbustable1 requests 2 CPUs and gets a cpu.weight of 79 burstable2 requests 1 CPU and gets a cpu.weight of 39 So this is the CPU each one will get (formula: (cpu.weight of pod / total cpu.weight) * number of CPUs):\nDanger\nKeep in mind that these calculations are not 100% accurate, since the CFS will try to assign CPU in the fairest way possible and results may vary depending on the system load and other process running on the system. This calculations assume that there are no guaranteed pods demanding CPU. 223 value comes from summing all the parents cpu weights 137 from kubepods.slice and 86 from kubepods-burstable.slice.\nburstable1: (79/223) * 4 = 1.41 CPU or ~141% burstable2: (39/223) * 4 = 0.69 CPU or ~69%~ Closing Thoughts Even if knowing the low-level details about resource management on Kubernetes may not be needed in a day-to-day basis, it’s great knowing how the different pieces are tied together. If you’re working on environments were performance and latencies are critical, like in telco environments, knowing this information can make the difference!\nOn top of that, some of the new features that cgroupsv2 enable are:\nContainer aware OOMKilled: Useful when you have sidecars, this could be used to OOMKill the sidecar container rather than your application container. Running Kubernetes System components root-less: More secure Kubernetes environments. Kubernetes Memory QoS: Better overall control of the memory used by pods. The Kubernetes Memory QoS kind of relates to this post, so I’ll be writing a new post covering that in the future.\nFinally, in the next section I’ll put interesting resources around the topic, some of them were my sources when learning all this stuff.\nUseful Resources KubeCon NA 2022 - Cgroupv2 is coming soon to a cluster near you talk.

The parent cgroups in a Kubernetes node will be configured as follows:</p><ul><li><code>system.slice</code>: A <em>cpu.weight</em> of <code>100</code>.</li><li><code>user.slice</code>: A <em>cpu.weight</em> of <code>100</code>.</li></ul><p>In a Kubernetes node, we won&rsquo;t have much/any user processes running. So at the end, the two cgroups competing for resources will be <code>system.slice</code> and <code>kubepods.slice</code>. But wait, what <em>cpu.weight</em> is configured for <code>kubepods.slice</code>?</p><p>When Kubelet starts it detects the number of CPUs available on the node, on top of that it reads the <code>systemReserved.cpu</code> configuration. That will give you a number of milicores available for Kubernetes to use on that node.</p><p>For example, if I have a 4 CPU node that&rsquo;s 4000 milicores, if I reserved 500m for the system resources (kubelet, sshd, etc.) that leaves Kubernetes with 3500 milicores that can be assigned to workloads.</p><p>Now, Kubelet knows that 3500 milicores is the amount of CPU that can be <em>assigned</em> to workloads (and assigned means that is more or less assured in case workloads request it). The cgroups <em>cpu.weight</em> needs to be configured so CPU get distributed accordingly, let&rsquo;s see how that&rsquo;s done:</p><ol><li>In the past (cgroupsv1), CPU Shares were used and every CPU was represented by 1024 Shares. Now, we need to translate from shares to weight and the community has a formula for that (more info <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2#phase-1-convert-from-cgroups-v1-settings-to-v2>here</a>).</li><li>In cgroupsv2 we still use Shares under the hood, but that&rsquo;s only because the formula created to not having to change the specification requires them. So we have a <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/pkg/kubelet/cm/helpers_linux.go#L45>constant</a> that sets the Shares/CPU to 1024 and a function that <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/pkg/kubelet/cm/helpers_linux.go#L85>translates milicores to shares</a>.</li><li>Finally, there is a function that <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/pkg/kubelet/cm/cgroup_manager_linux.go#L566>translates CPU Shares to CPU Weight</a> using the formula from 1.</li></ol><p>After we know the weight that needs to be applied to the <code>kubepods.slice</code>, the relevant code that does that is <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/pkg/kubelet/cm/node_container_manager_linux.go#L115>here</a> and <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/pkg/kubelet/cm/cgroup_manager_linux.go#L435>here</a>.</p><p>Continuing with the example, the <em>cpu.weight</em> for our 4 CPU node with 500 milicores reserved for system resources would be:</p><p>Formula being used: (((cpuShares - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1</p><p>cpuShares = 3.5 Cores * 1024 = 3584</p><p>cpu.weight = (((3584 - 2) * 9999) / 262142) + 1 = 137,62</p><p>If we check our node:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>cat /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods.slice/cpu.weight

The <code>max</code> from the <code>cpu.max</code> config means that the processes can use all the CPU time available on the system (which varies depending on the speed of your CPU).</p><h4 id=cgroup-configuration-for-a-burstable-pod>Cgroup configuration for a Burstable Pod<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cgroup-configuration-for-a-burstable-pod>#</a></h4><p>We will be using this pod definition:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nt>apiVersion</span><span class=p>:</span><span class=w> </span><span class=l>v1</span><span class=w>

The second value <code>100000</code> specific the length of the period. Once the processes consume the time specified by this quota, they will be throttled for the remained of the period and won&rsquo;t be allowed to run until the next period. This specific configuration allows our processes to run every 0.2 seconds of every 1 second (1/5th). On the memory side, the container can use up to 100Mi once it reaches this value if kernel will try to reclaim some memory, if it cannot be reclaimed the container will be OOMKilled.</p><p>Even if guaranteed QoS will <em>ensure</em> that your application gets the CPU it wants, sometimes your application may benefit from burstable capabilities since the CPU won&rsquo;t be throttled during peaks (e.g: more visits to a web server).</p><h3 id=how-kubepods-cgroups-compete-for-resources>How Kubepods Cgroups compete for resources<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-kubepods-cgroups-compete-for-resources>#</a></h3><p>In the previous examples we have seen how the different pods get different CPU configurations. But what happens if they compete against them for resources?</p><p>In order for the <code>guaranteed</code> pods to have more priority than <code>burstable</code> pods, and these to have more priority than <code>besteffort</code> different weights get set for the three slices. In a 4 CPU node these are the settings we get:</p><ul><li>Guaranteed pods will run under <code>kubepods.slice</code> which has a <code>cpu.weight</code> of <code>137</code>.</li><li>Burstable pods will run under <code>kubepods.slice/kubepods-burstable.slice</code> which has a <code>cpu.weight</code> of <code>86</code>.</li><li>BestEffort pods will run under <code>kubepods.slice/kubepods-besteffort.slice</code> which has a <code>cpu.weight</code> of <code>1</code>.</li></ul><p>As we can see from above configuration, the weights define the CPU priority. Keep in mind that pods running inside the same parent slice can compete for resources. In this situation, when they&rsquo;re competing for resources the <code>total cpu.weight</code> will be the one from summing all their parent cgroup cpu weights. For example:</p><p>We have two burstable pods, these are the cpu weights that will be configured (based on the formulas we have seen so far):</p><ul><li><code>bustable1</code> requests 2 CPUs and gets a <em>cpu.weight</em> of <code>79</code></li><li><code>burstable2</code> requests 1 CPU and gets a <em>cpu.weight</em> of <code>39</code></li></ul><p>So this is the CPU each one will get (formula: <code>(cpu.weight of pod / total cpu.weight) * number of CPUs</code>):</p><div class="admonition danger"><p class=admonition-title>Danger</p><p class=admonition>Keep in mind that these calculations are not 100% accurate, since the CFS will try to assign CPU in the fairest way possible and results may vary depending on the system load and other process running on the system. This calculations assume that there are no guaranteed pods demanding CPU. <code>223</code> value comes from summing all the parents cpu weights <code>137</code> from <code>kubepods.slice</code> and <code>86</code> from <code>kubepods-burstable.slice</code>.</p></div><ul><li><code>burstable1</code>: (79/223) * 4 = 1.41 CPU or ~141%</li><li><code>burstable2</code>: (39/223) * 4 = 0.69 CPU or ~69%~</li></ul><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing Thoughts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#closing-thoughts>#</a></h2><p>Even if knowing the low-level details about resource management on Kubernetes may not be needed in a day-to-day basis, it&rsquo;s great knowing how the different pieces are tied together.
